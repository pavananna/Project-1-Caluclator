Creating a GUI caluclator by usiing tkinter library 

By using this GUI calucaltor we can perform the mathematical caluclations like additions,subtractions,multiplication and divisions.
For creating this GUI caluclator first we have to import tkinter library.
After importing tkinter library we have to import all the modules of the tkinter library.
After importing we have to create the widget(window) for the caluclator and also to display that widget we have to use "mainloop" keyword.
Now we have to create one Entry dialouge box for taking input and also for displaying the output.
Now we have to create number buttons like 0,1,2 .... ,9 and mathematicatical buttons like +,-,*,/ by using Button keyword.
Like above we have to create clear,equal_to buttons by using buttons keyword.
Now we have to define functions for working of buttons and then we have to combine the functions with their respective button by using "command" keyword.
